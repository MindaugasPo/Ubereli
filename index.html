                    This page can be considered as a motivation letter for applying to Uber software engineer position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a software developer who have worked, in various companies, positions and technologies for some years. 
                    I believe I can bring skills to Uber that will help you to build an even better company and deliver better 
                    value to your customers. I’ve been thinking about what I could do for Uber and came up with a business 
                    plan extension from which I believe you can profit quite a lot. 
                    Without further adieu please allow me to describe it. I named it “Project UberEli”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I considered one of the main businesses of Uber is passenger transportation. A dedicated trip by a driver 
                    is done from point A to point B. Let’s call this activity “dimension 1”.
                    Then I thought, what if there could be other dimensions which could reuse “dimension 1”, 
                    save resources and give Uber an edge against competitors? This “dimension 2” that I mention could be parcel 
                    delivery. And why is it “dimension 2”? Because parcel delivery won’t need to have a dedicated trip from 
                    point A to point B. Uber drivers move around the city all the time. And parcels can be delivered 
                    asynchronously. The basic algorithm is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Driver gets to a point A to pickup a passenger</li>
                    <li>Driver takes passenger to point B</li>
                    <li>Driver picks up a parcel near point B</li>
                    <li>Driver continues transporting passengers, until one of the passengers’ destination is close enough to parcel’s destination</li>
                    <li>After delivering this passenger driver may deliver the parcel to its destination</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This algorithm illustrated the fact that there was no dedicated trip planned and executed for the parcel. 
                    Parcel was traveling in the car trunk while the driver was transporting passengers. Other parcel delivery 
                    companies have to plant trips and make them. Uber in this case can avoid that.
                    When will it work? It won’t work with parcels that have dedicated pickup/delivery times. Because you can’t 
                    move around the city with the parcel for unlimited time. But it will work when there are no time restrictions 
                    or time windows are wide. Examples of that are pretty much any online purchases when the shop promises to 
                    deliver within a day or two and the thing is small enough to fit into a regular car trunk. And there is no 
                    need to mention how big this market is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a shop’s customer buys a laptop. Shop promises to deliver it within two days. Then Uber drivers 
                    will be able to pick up the parcel the same day and carry it around for two days. I do not have the data for 
                    Uber driver’s movement, but I am predicting that statistically the driver will eventually get close enough to 
                    the parcel destination within those two days. This idea of course should be investigated using data and proved 
                    to be possible to work. Since I cannot do that, I thought I could illustrate this idea at least a little bit. 
                    I created the canvas above where you can draw trips and parcels. If you create a situation when the parcel pickup point 
                    is close enough to the passenger trip destination - it will be marked by a circle. Also if the parcel 
                    destination point is close to the passenger destination location - it will also mark that with a circle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please check the canvas of how the algorithm could look like. Blue lines represent passenger trips and yellow lines represent 
                    parcels. Red circles show that these trips can be combined. The main point to observe is that there is no 
                    dedicated trip to deliver the parcel - it will be delivered while passengers are delivered.
